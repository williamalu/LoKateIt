If approaching from the service entry (shown here as an opening on the left wall), you will first encounter one of two long, communal tables, running parallel to the left wall. These take up about half of the length of the room, with space to navigate around both ends and tables lining the sides. Past these are more tables set up perpendicular to these two, and not quite as long. Along the right wall is a counter space with stools, and in the upper right corner are three smaller, circular tables." title="Cartoon map of the dining area.
